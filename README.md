# MotorizationKit
custom PCB with connectors that make wiring on my motorized iron man helmet simpler and easier, also allowing for easier flexibility


I made the schematic for the PCB. I used KiCad, and I am going to be using an Arduino Nano. Whilst wiring, I had to do extensive research on what parts I am using and which pins connect to what.

I then assigned footprints. I will be using 2_pin JST micro ports and then 2 3-pin jumper pins.

This all took me 1hr and 42 minutes.

I created/designed my PCB and routed it. I used both the back and front of the PCB to keep wiring as clean as possible, and I rounded the corners of the PCB using Edge Cuts so that corners of the PCB were not sharp.

I then added 3D models to my board in KiCad's 3D viewer to visualize the PCB and see what it looks like.

Using the 3D models helped me identify what exact parts that I need to use, which will be my next step. 

Altogether, all of this took 2hrs AND 36 minutes.

I researched the products that I am going to use on the PCB.

For the Arduino Uno, I found a cheap USB-C one from Ali Express with free shipping, which is the one I have chosen:

I then researched the 2-pin JST micro connectors for the PCB. For these, I specifically looked out for right angle connectors so that when on the PCB and wires are plugged in, they stay compact and come out the side of the PC, allowing the PCB to fit comfortably in the helmet.

For the wires that would plug into the micro connectors, I found some on Ali Express that would be suitable and would fit.

Finally, for the 3-pin connectors for the servo motors, I have chosen simple break-off jumper pins, that will connect to the stock connectors on the servos, which I will not be buying as I already have them.

This all took me 1 hour and 40 minutes.

I redesigned my circuit in Tinkercad to make it easier for me to understand the circuit.

I had to use an Arduino micro in the diagram because I could not find the Arduino Nano in the application. 

This took me an hour and 47 minutes.

I added all the parts I need to my cart to add up the total price.

I now know my budget for my project, and it will be Tier 5, at 20 pounds.

I also uploaded my prod.zip folder to JLCPCB to get a quote for the PCB.

Adding the prices together only took me around 10 minutes.
