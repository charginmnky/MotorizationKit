# MotorizationKit
custom PCB with connectors that make wiring on my motorized iron man helmet simpler and easier, also allowing for easier flexibility


I made the schematic for the PCB. I used KiCad, and I am going to be using an Arduino Nano. Whilst wiring, I had to do extensive research on what parts I am using and which pins connect to what.

I then assigned footprints. I will be using 2_pin JST micro ports and then 2 3-pin jumper pins.

This all took me 1hr and 42 minutes.
